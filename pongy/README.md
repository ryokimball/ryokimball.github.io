# pongy

I made a pong.

game:
    pong
moving objects:
    left paddle, right paddle, ball
Controls:
    left paddle: e/f
    right paddle: i/j
text: 
    game time, round time, left score, right score
position & size: 
    bottom of board is 40 px above bottom of window (window.innerHeight - 40)
    left paddle is one tenth the size of the window
    text is 10 pixels tall. 
    **Gotta figure out how to keep x/y positions the same as a ratio when the screen changes sizes.
